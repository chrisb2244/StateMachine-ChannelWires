# StateMachine-ChannelWires

Demo code to test the plausibility of an idea from Steve Watts regarding making a state machine in LabVIEW that looks like a state machine diagram.

The transitions are modelled by Channel Wires (LabVIEW 2016 onwards) and the states are contained each in a single VI.

The code is written with LabVIEW 2017.
